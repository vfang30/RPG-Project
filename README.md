# RPG Project
* All assets are placeholders

A hobby project I started in the summer of 2023. Most features and ideas for the game are not finalized and the game is still work in progress.

Currently, the overworld is a 2D side scroller where the player can move around and jump.

Combat is turn-based, and the player has a few different options. Each character will have stats and unique moves they can obtain as the player gains experience and levels up.
